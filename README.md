# Robotic Arm
<b>A visualization openGl and cpp code for full robotic arm model with four fingers, and their limitations.</b>

## Implementation details:
<ul>
<li>We completed the model of the arm and missing fingers by applying different transformations.</li>
<li>We animated the model by animated the elbow, shoulder and fingers and its rotated limitations.</li>
</ul>

## Issues we faced:
<ul>
<li>Dealing with glPushMatrix and glPopMatrix functions in openGl confused us.</li>
<b>We determine the transformation functions, current matrix and stack from the first of the code to the end and solve of that.</b>
</ul>
